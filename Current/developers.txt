DEVELOPER NOTES
===============


Current compilation method supported: MinGW / MSYS

IMPORTANT! You MUST have LibDev included until I can get bugs worked out regarding using newer libraries/etc...

Compilation Instructions:

1. At the MSYS prompt cd yourself into the main directory of this source code.
2. Type in make
3. Sit back and relax :P


Important Information:

This uses a compilation of libraries and headers which I have put together called LibDev, which is available on SVN and
sometime on the web, hopefully via a dedicated Wiki article.


LibDev Installation:

1. Obtain the LibDev from SVN or (in the future) via Wiki article.
2. Create a directory in drive C (if other drive letters, then you must edit Makefile where /c/LibDev and change to /[drive letter without colon]/LibDev.
3. Copy or move all contents downloaded of LibDev excluding the whole directory name itself into the newly created folder.
4. Your done :)
