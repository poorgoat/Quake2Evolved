					Quake II Evolved

Version 1.0



ABOUT THE PROJECT
-----------------

Quake II Evolved (Q2E) project was initially started as a project to fix some important bugs found
in Quake II when the source code was released by John Carmack of id Software many years ago.  Q2E
became a project to enhance the functionality of the Quake II engine shortly there-after.

Sometime in 2005 the origonal project leader known as "berserk" decided to seize his efforts on the
source code and then I (Davy2002A) took it over.  Initially I didn't have much experience with C/C++
and also didn't have too much time to put fourth to the project and for a few years I hadn't
contributed any source code changes, until 2008 when I decided to revive the old project after
numerous requests by fans of the project wanting interesting enhancements to be added to the
game engine.
